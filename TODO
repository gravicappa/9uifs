# WM
## Define WM (window manager) interface
	- probably make an interface for wm to be an external application
		(full blown 9p fs or some simple text/binary stream).

# UI
- Simultaneous event output into /event, view/event, uiobj/event files.
	Not sure if more than one event stream is required.
- Think about keyboard manipulation.
- New widgets: check buttons, radio buttons, sliders, progress bars, canvas.
