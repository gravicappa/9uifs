# WM
## Define WM (window manager) interface
  - probably make an interface for wm to be an external application
    (full blown 9p fs or some simple text/binary stream).

# UI
- Simultaneous event output into /event, view/event, uiobj/event files.
- Optimize label, button text change redraws.
- Think about keyboard manipulation.
- New widgets:
    - page
    - check button
    - radio button
    - slider
    - progress bar
    - canvas.
