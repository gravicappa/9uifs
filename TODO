# FS

- Static directory structure probably can be defined as statid data.
  + Qid can be stored in separate set.

# WM

The conept of separate WM is not required. Allowing importing widgets from
other clients is enough (with sane permission management).

# UI

Choose widget name defining character:

    widgets/service/wifi/_status/places/0

    widgets/service/wifi/+status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/@status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/^status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/:status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/&status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/%status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/#status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/$status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/!status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/,status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/=status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/-status/places/0
    widgets/service/wifi/~status/places/0
