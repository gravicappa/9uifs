# General

## Unified keyboard constants
## Window manager
### Grabbing keys mechanism

## Add separate attach root support for one client(?).

## Static directory structure probably can be defined as static data.

## Access to somehow sandboxed local FS (?).
## Sound support (??).
## Channel for piping data to/from subprocess.

## GL support.

Almost every modern computing platform has GPU. It's a waste not to use it.

## Think about default keybindings

Probably it is a good idea to autoassign keys to buttons.

## Timed update(?)

## Text entry widget
## Check button widget (?)
## Radio button widget (?)
## Slider widget (?)

## Assign id to images and manipulate them by it by `ctl` commands.
Good for performance.
