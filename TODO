# General

## Unified keyboard constants
Currently SDL constants are used without translation. Maybe stick to them.

## Window manager
Probably should add free-placement control manager in addition to uiobj_grid.

## Add separate attach root support for one client(?).
The only reason for this is to tunnel separate application through one
connection.

## Static directory structure probably can be defined as static data.

## GL support.
Almost every modern computing platform has GPU. It's a waste not to use it.

## Think about default keybindings
Probably it is a good idea to autoassign keys to controls (like in vimperator
or similar).

## Timed update(?)
For single-threaded synchronous client (e.g. written in sh) it maybe useful to
trigger an alarm event after given amount of time.

## Text entry widget
## Check button widget (?)
## Radio button widget (?)
## Slider widget (?)

## Assign id to images and manipulate them by it by `ctl` commands.
Good for performance.
