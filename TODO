# FS

* Static directory structure probably can be defined as static data.
  - Qid can be stored in separate set.
* Access to somehow sandboxed local FS.

* Optimize label, button text change redraws.
* Think about default keybindings
  - Autoassign keys to buttons?
* Timed update?
* New widgets:
    - entry,
    - check button?,
    - radio button?,
    - slider?,
    - progress bar??,
    - vector canvas (like tk's canvas(n)).
