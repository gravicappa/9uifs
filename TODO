# General
## Assign a name to application.
## Add multiple attach support for one client.

## Static directory structure probably can be defined as static data.

## Access to somehow sandboxed local FS.

## Sound support.

## GL support.

Almost every modern computing platform has GPU. It's a waste not to use it.

## Think about default keybindings

Probably it is a good idea to autoassign keys to buttons.

## Timed update(?)

## Text entry widget
## Check button widget (?)
## Radio button widget (?)
## Slider widget (?)

## Access to exported widgets from another clients.

## Assign id to images and manipulate them by it in surface's `ctl` commands.
It's good for performance.
