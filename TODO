# FS

* Static directory structure probably can be defined as static data.

  - Qid can be stored in separate set.

* Access to somehow sandboxed local FS.

# UI

* Think about default keybindings

  - Autoassign keys to buttons?

* Timed update?

* New widgets:

    - text entry,
    - check button?,
    - radio button?,
    - slider?,
    - progress bar??.

* Access to exported widgets from another clients.

* Assign id to images and manipulate them by it in surface's `ctl` commands
  for performance.
